Write beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks.
All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests
Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes
Previously we created a method to generate a dictionary representation of an instance (method to_dict()).

Now itâ€™s time to re-create an instance with this dictionary representation.
Now we can recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation
Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to have these commands
Write a class User that inherits from BaseModel
Write all those classes that inherit from BaseModel
Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of all our new classes: Place, State, City, Amenity and Review

Update your command interpreter (console.py) to allow those actions: show, create, destroy, update and all with all classes created previously
